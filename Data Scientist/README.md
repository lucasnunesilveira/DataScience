# Project Installation and Execution

  

🚀 This project was developed to assess skills in Data Science. Initially, data analysis and preprocessing were performed, followed by the application of a Linear Regression model. The code was written in Python, utilizing several essential libraries:

  

-  **Pandas** and **Numpy** : For data handling and manipulation.📝

-  **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization and graphical analysis.📊

-  **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the linear regression model.📈

  

## Environment Setup

  

To set up the development environment:

  

1.  **Virtual Environment (optional)**:

- It's recommended to use a virtual environment like `conda` or `venv` to keep project dependencies isolated.

  

2.  **Installing Dependencies**:

- Create a virtual environment (optional):

```

conda create --name data_science_env python=3.8

conda activate data_science_env

```

- Install dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

  

3.  **Environment Variables**:

- If needed, set environment variables in the `.env` file to configure API keys, tokens, or other sensitive settings.

  

## Running the Project

  

To run the project:

  

1.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:

- Start Jupyter Notebook:

```

jupyter notebook

```

- Open the notebook containing the project code (`project_data_science.ipynb`).

  

2.  **Executing the Code**:

- Run the notebook cells sequentially to load data, perform preprocessing, train the linear regression model, and evaluate its performance.

  

## Contributions and Support

  

- If you'd like to contribute improvements or report issues, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.

  

🔧 This project was developed using Anaconda to simplify dependency management and the development environment. Ensure all dependencies are installed as specified in the `requirements.txt` file before starting.
